## Security Framework Overview

### Zero Trust Principles

Our security model is built on five core zero trust principles:

1. **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Authenticate and authorize every request regardless of location
2. **Least Privilege Access**: Grant minimum necessary permissions for specific tasks
3. **Assume Breach**: Design systems assuming compromise has occurred
4. **Verify Explicitly**: Use identity, device, location, and behavioral context
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection and automated response

## Network Security Patterns

### Three-Tier Security Model

Our network security follows a three-tier isolation model:

- **Public Subnet (DMZ)**: Only load balancers exposed to internet
- **Private Subnet (Application Tier)**: Application containers with no direct internet access
- **Database Subnet (Data Tier)**: Database instances completely isolated from internet

### Security Groups (Stateful Firewall) - Design Patterns

#### Web Tier Security Group Pattern

```yaml
Purpose: Protect internet-facing load balancers
Ingress Rules:
  - HTTP (port 80) from CloudFront IP ranges only
  - HTTPS (port 443) from CloudFront IP ranges only
  - Deny all other inbound traffic

Egress Rules:
  - <applicationPort> to Application Tier Security Group
  - HTTPS (port 443) to internet for health checks and AWS APIs
```

#### Application Tier Security Group Pattern

```yaml
Purpose: Protect application containers
Ingress Rules:
  - <applicationPort> from Web Tier Security Group only
  - Deny all other inbound traffic

Egress Rules:
  - <databasePort> to Database Tier Security Group
  - HTTPS (port 443) to internet for AWS APIs and external services
  - DNS (port 53) for name resolution
```

#### Database Tier Security Group Pattern

```yaml
Purpose: Protect database instances
Ingress Rules:
  - <databasePort> from Application Tier Security Group only
  - Deny all other inbound traffic

Egress Rules:
  - Ephemeral ports back to Application Tier Security Group
  - (RDS managed instances typically don't require explicit egress rules)
```

### Network ACLs (Stateless Firewall) - AWS Recommended Patterns

#### Public Subnet NACL Pattern

```yaml
Ingress Rules (numbered 100, 110, etc.):
  - HTTP (80) from 0.0.0.0/0
  - HTTPS (443) from 0.0.0.0/0
  - Ephemeral ports (1024-65535) from <vpcCidrBlock>
  - DENY ALL (rule 32767)

Egress Rules:
  - <applicationPort> to <vpcCidrBlock>
  - HTTPS (443) to 0.0.0.0/0
  - Ephemeral ports (1024-65535) to 0.0.0.0/0
  - DENY ALL (rule 32767)
```

#### Private Subnet NACL Pattern

```yaml
Ingress Rules:
  - <applicationPort> from <vpcCidrBlock>
  - Ephemeral ports (1024-65535) from 0.0.0.0/0 (for return traffic)
  - DENY ALL (rule 32767)

Egress Rules:
  - <databasePort> to <vpcCidrBlock>
  - HTTPS (443) to 0.0.0.0/0 (for AWS APIs)
  - Ephemeral ports (1024-65535) to <vpcCidrBlock>
  - DENY ALL (rule 32767)
```

#### Database Subnet NACL Pattern

```yaml
Ingress Rules:
  - <databasePort> from <vpcCidrBlock>
  - DENY ALL (rule 32767)

Egress Rules:
  - Ephemeral ports (1024-65535) to <vpcCidrBlock>
  - DENY ALL (rule 32767)
```

### VPC Endpoints Strategy

Implement VPC endpoints for all AWS services to eliminate internet traffic:

- **Secrets Manager**: For credential retrieval
- **SSM Parameter Store**: For configuration access
- **ECR**: For container image pulls
- **CloudWatch**: For logging and metrics
- **S3**: For static assets (if used)

## Identity and Access Management Strategy

### Least Privilege Principle

All IAM roles and policies must follow the principle of least privilege:

#### Container Execution Roles

```yaml
ECS Task Execution Role (Infrastructure):
  - ECR image pulling permissions
  - CloudWatch log creation
  - Secrets Manager read access for runtime secrets
  - Limited to specific resource ARNs

ECS Task Role (Application Runtime):
  - SSM Parameter Store read access for configuration
  - CloudWatch metrics publishing
  - S3 access (if required for application data)
  - X-Ray tracing permissions
  - Limited to specific resource ARNs and conditions
```

#### Resource-Based Access Patterns

- **Secrets Manager**: Resource policies restricting access to specific roles
- **S3 Buckets**: Bucket policies with IP and role restrictions
- **RDS**: Database-level users with minimal required permissions
- **Parameter Store**: Path-based access control with KMS encryption

### Cross-Service Access Controls

#### Condition-Based Policies

All IAM policies should include relevant conditions:

- **aws:RequestedRegion**: Limit to approved regions
- **aws:SecureTransport**: Require HTTPS/TLS
- **aws:PrincipalTag**: Role-based access control
- **aws:CurrentTime**: Time-based access restrictions

## Secrets Management Strategy

### AWS Secrets Manager vs SSM Parameter Store

#### AWS Secrets Manager (For Sensitive Data)

**Use For:**

- Database credentials with automatic rotation
- API keys for external services
- SSL/TLS certificates
- OAuth tokens and secrets

**Key Features:**

- Automatic rotation capabilities
- Cross-region replication
- Fine-grained access control
- Audit trail integration

#### SSM Parameter Store (For Configuration)

**Use For:**

- Application configuration parameters
- Feature flags and toggles
- Non-sensitive environment variables
- Application settings

**Key Features:**

- SecureString type with KMS encryption
- Parameter hierarchies for organization
- Cost-effective for configuration data
- Version history and rollback

### Secret Naming Conventions

```yaml
Secrets Manager:
  - Pattern: /<environment>/<application>/<component>/<secret-type>
  - Examples: /prod/webapp/database/credentials
      /prod/webapp/external/payment-api-key

SSM Parameter Store:
  - Pattern: /<application>/<environment>/<component>/<parameter>
  - Examples: /webapp/prod/app/max-connections
      /webapp/prod/features/new-checkout-enabled
```

### Access Patterns

#### Secret Rotation Strategy

- **Database Credentials**: Automatic 30-day rotation
- **API Keys**: Manual quarterly rotation with notification
- **Certificates**: Automatic renewal via ACM when possible
- **Application Secrets**: Manual rotation based on security requirements

## Container Security Guidelines

### Image Security

#### Base Image Requirements

- Use official, minimal base images (Alpine, Distroless)
- Implement multi-stage builds to reduce attack surface
- Regular vulnerability scanning with ECR image scanning
- Image signing and verification for production deployments

#### Container Runtime Security

```yaml
Security Context Requirements:
  - Run as non-root user (UID > 1000)
  - Read-only root filesystem where possible
  - Drop all Linux capabilities unless specifically required
  - Enable init process for proper signal handling
  - Resource limits (CPU, memory) to prevent DoS
```

#### Container Networking

- No privileged containers in production
- Host network mode prohibited
- Container-to-container communication via service discovery
- All external communication through controlled egress rules

### Image Lifecycle Management

#### ECR Repository Configuration

- **Image Scanning**: Scan on push enabled
- **Encryption**: KMS encryption for images at rest
- **Lifecycle Policies**: Retain only required image versions
- **Access Control**: Repository-level IAM policies

## Data Protection Requirements

### Encryption Standards

#### Encryption at Rest

- **RDS Databases**: AWS KMS encryption required
- **EBS Volumes**: Default encryption enabled
- **S3 Buckets**: Server-side encryption with KMS
- **Parameter Store**: SecureString parameters with KMS
- **Secrets Manager**: Default KMS encryption

#### Encryption in Transit

- **ALB to Client**: TLS 1.2 minimum via ACM certificates
- **ALB to Containers**: HTTP within VPC (private network)
- **Container to RDS**: SSL/TLS connections required
- **Container to AWS APIs**: HTTPS required via VPC endpoints

### Key Management Strategy

#### KMS Key Usage Patterns

- **Application-specific keys**: Separate keys per application/environment
- **Service-specific keys**: Dedicated keys for RDS, EBS, S3
- **Rotation policy**: Annual key rotation for long-term keys
- **Access control**: Resource-based key policies with conditions
